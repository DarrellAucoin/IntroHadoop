# Motivation

__Q:__ Why do we need Hadoop when we have SQL?

- Our capability of storing data has outpaced our ability to read it
    - Harddrives speeds have not improved as fast as their capacity

- Processing capacity have bottlenecked, increasing the need for parallelization
of tasks

- SQL servers do not scale very well in comparison to Hadoop
    - SQL is best for Gigabytes of data, Hadoop for Terabyes/Petrabyes of data
    - SQL skills are still useful in a Hadoop ecosystem (Hive, Spark SQL,
Impala)

__Q:__ Who uses Hadoop?


<iframe src=http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/PoweredBy#A width=1000 height=600></iframe>



__Q:__ Why learn Hadoop?

- According to [O'Reilly Data Science
Survey](http://www.oreilly.com/data/free/2014-data-science-salary-survey.csp),
knowledge of Hadoop and related tools are correlated to the highest salaries in
Data Science
    - The highest salaries are correlated to joint knowledge of Hadoop and SQL

## Hadoop vs RDBMS (SQL)  


|  | RDBMS (SQL) | Hadoop |  
|--|-------------|--------|  
| Data Size | Gigabytes | Terabyte/Petrabytes |  
| Access | Interactive and batch | Batch |  
| Updates | Read and write many times | Write once, read many times |  
| Structure | Static schema (highly structured) | Dynamic schema (Semi-
structured) |  
| Integrity | High | Low |  
| Scaling | Nonlinear | Linear |  
| Schema | Write-on Schema | Read-on Schema |  
| Data formating | Normalized | Optimally De-normalized |  

When going from a RDBMS to Hadoop, the biggest trade off is the guanrantee of
atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability for scalability.

__Write-on Schema__: Information is inputted, transformed and written into the
predefined schema: we can enforce consistency through this.

__Read-on Schema__: Bring in files without any predefined gatekeeping or
consistency services. The schema is created when reading the files using a set
of predefined rules. For instance, a comma seperated file could have it's first
entry interpretated as a string, the second as an integer, the third as a float,
etc.

# What is Hadoop?

__Definition.__ __Hadoop__ is a MapReduce framework built on top of a
distributed file system (HDFS for Hadoop).

- Hadoop is distributed system, meaning it's an interconnected system of
computers that looks to the user as just one single entity.
<center>
![alt text](Images/Distributed_Hadoop.png)
</center>

- When a client submits a MapReduce Job, the job is split into several tasks and
the nodes takes on a fixed number of tasks per node
- Written in mainly in Java, with some components written in C and bash
- Designed around processing high throughput of large data rather than response
times
- Hadoop is highly configurable, both in it's operations and job configurations

__Note:__

- All components and modules have to be installed on every node in a cluster
(i.e. to use a module in R, the module has to be installed on every node)
- A single node may be running several tasks from several different jobs

## Hadoop V1.x and V2.x

Due to compatiability breaking problems with V1.x, V2.x was created:
- 2.x allows Hadoop Streaming to stream binary data compared to just text with
1.x
- 2.x is more scalable, 1.x has a bottleneck in it's design (a singular
NameNode)
- Various Hadoop configuration options changed names

## What is MapReduce?

__Definition.__ _MapReduce_ is a programming paradigm model of using parallel,
distributed algorithims to process or generate data sets. MapRedeuce is composed
of two main functions:

__Map(k,v)__: Filters and sorts data.

__Reduce(k,v)__: Aggregates data according to keys (k).

### Hadoop MapReduce Components

###Hadoop 1.x
__JobTracker__ Coordinates jobs, scheduling task for tasktrackers and records
progress for each job
- If a task fails, it's rescheduled on different TaskTracker

__TaskTracker__ Runs tasks and send progress reports to the jobtracker

###Hadoop 2.x
__ResourceManager__: Arbitrates resources among all applications in the system.

__ApplicationMaster__: A per-application framework tasked with negotiating
resources from the ResourceManager and working with the NodeManager(s) to
execute and manitor tasks the component tasks.

__MRAppMaster__: per application

__NodeManager__: YARN's per-node agent:
- Keeping up-to-date with ResourceManager
- Overseeing individual tasks life-cycle management
    – Constructing a JVM, running the task, then deconstructing the JVM

- Monitoring resource usage for each task: memory, CPU
- Tracking node-health
- Logging management and auxiliary services

## What is HDFS?

__Definition.__ __HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)__ is a fault tolerant,
distributed, scalable file-system accross multiple interconnected computer
systems (nodes).

__Fault tolerant__ means that a single node failure will not halt operations. It
does this by replicating the data accross multiple nodes (usually 3).

__Distributed__ means that data is shared accross multiple computer nodes. This
means that one node can have data that another node does not. The data nodes can
“talk” to each other to balance the data.

__Scalable__ means that performance for clients/node are roughly linear. To
increase performance, add new nodes which allows a greater number of clients.

### HDFS Components

__NameNode__ The master node: maintains the namespace of the directories and
files and manages the blocks on each DataNode.

- Usually the most RAM intensive component of HDFS (keeping all metadata of
files/directories in memory)
    - Best to have input files at least a gigabyte in size
    - The greatest bottleneck for Hadoop 1.x, having only 1 NameNode: too many
files requires more ram than the NameNode can provide. Hadoop 2.x uses HDFS
Federation, a collection of independent NameNodes.

__DataNode__ Provides the actual storage of the blocks of files.

__Secondary NameNode__ Performs periodic checkpoints of the NameNode and in the
event of NameNode failure, can restart the NameNode from last checkpoint (can
take a while and a chance of data loss).
- Secondary Namespace lags behind primary, thus total failure of primary will
likely result in data loss
- Otherwise, copy metadata to secondary and run that as the new primary

# Various Hadoop Projects

[__Hive__](https://hive.apache.org/): Allows users to create SQL-like queries
(HQL) and convert them to MapReduce jobs. (`INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` statements
are not allowed).

[__Pig__](http://pig.apache.org/): An easy to learn hadoop-based language that
is adept at very deep, very long data pipelines. Very commonly used with DataFu,
LinkedIn assortment of User Defined Functions useful for data analysis.

[__Spark__](https://spark.apache.org/): Another implementation of MapReduce that
is more effective for iterative algorithms (machine learning algorithms). Also
has built in packages for Spark SQL, and machine learning.

[__HBase__](http://hbase.apache.org/): Non-relational database allowing low-
latency, quick lookups in Hadoop. Can do updates, inserts, and deletes.

[__Oozie__](http://oozie.apache.org/): A workflow processing that lets users
define a series of jobs written in multiple languages: Hadoop, Pig, and Hive and
then link them to one another.

[__Avro__](http://avro.apache.org/): A data serialization system that allows for
encoding the schema of Hadoop files. It is adept at parsing data and performing
removed procedure calls.

[__Mahout__](http://mahout.apache.org/): A data mining library using the most
popular data mining algorithims for performing clustering, regression testing
and statistical modeling and implements them using the Map Reduce model.

[__Sqoop__](http://sqoop.apache.org/): A conectivity tool for moving data from
non-Hadoop databases (SQL, etc.) into Hadoop.

[__HCatalog__](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/hcatalog/): A centralized metadata
mangagement and sharing service for Hadoop, allowing a unified view of all data
in Hadoop clusters.

# MapReduce Phases

MapReduce is broken down into several steps:

1. Record Reader
2. Map
3. Combiner (Optional)
4. Partitioner
5. Shuffle and Sort
6. Reduce
7. Output Format

## Record Reader

__Record Reader__ Translates an input into records to be processed by the user-
defined map function in the form of a key-value pair on each map cluster.

- The key is positional information (the number of bytes from start of file) and
the value is the chunk of data composing a single record.

![alt text](images/MapReduceInput.png)

- In hadoop, each map task's is an input split which is usually simply a HDFS
block
    - Hadoop tries scheduling map tasks on nodes where that block is stored
(data locality)
    - If a file is broken mid-record in a block, hadoop requests the additional
information from the next block in the series

## Map

__Map__ _User defined function_ outputing intermediate key-value pairs for the
reducers
![alt text](images/MapReduceMapper.png)

__key__ ($k_{2}$): Later, MapReduce will group and possibly aggregate data
according to these keys, choosing the right keys is here is important for a good
MapReduce job.

__value__ ($v_{2}$): The data to be grouped according to it's keys.

## Combiner (Optional)

__Combiner__ _User defined function_ that aggregates data according to
intermediate keys on a mapper node
![alt text](images/MapReduceCombiner.png)

- This can usually reduce the amount of data to be sent over the network
increasing efficiency
![alt text](images/combiner.png)

- Combiner should be written with the idea that it is executed over most but not
all map tasks. ie. 
![alt text](images/combiner_key_value.png)

- Usually very similar or the same code as the reduce method.

## Partitioner

__Partitioner__ Sends intermediate key-value pairs (k,v) to reducer by
$$\mbox{Reducer}=\mbox{hash}\left(\mbox{k}\right)\pmod{R}$$
![alt text](images/MapReducePartitioner.png)

- will usually result in a roughly balanced load accross the reducers while
ensuring that all key-value pairs are grouped by their key on a single reducer.
- A balancer system is in place for the cases when the key-values are too
unevenly distributed.
- In hadoop, the intermediate keys ($k_{2},v_{2}$) are written to the local
harddrive and grouped by which reduce they will be sent to and their key.

## Shuffle and Sort

__Shuffle and Sort__ On reducer node, sorts by key to help group equivalent keys
![alt text](images/MapReduceSort.png)

## Reduce

__Reduce__ _User Defined Function_ that aggregates data (v) according to keys
(k) to send key-value pairs to output
![alt text](images/MapReduceReduce.png)

## Output Format

__Output Format__ Translates final key-value pairs to file format (tab-seperated
by default).
![alt text](images/MapReduceOutput.png)

## MapReduce Example: Word Count

# HDFS Operation

__HDFS (Hadoop File System)__: A distributed file system designed to store huge
streamable files running on commodity hardware.

__Distributed File System__: A file system that manages and stores files across
a network of computer allowing files to be parititioned and stored across
multiple computer nodes.

__Community Hardware__: Commonly available hardware. i.e. the computer in front
of you.

__Huge Files__: File sizes from 100MB to petabytes.

__Streamable__: Documents in HDFS must be able to be partitioned where each
partition can be read independently.

- A LaTeX document is __NOT__ streamable as the begining of the document defines
parameters that are used throught the whole document
- A comma seperated value (CSV) text document __IS__ streamable as it is
readable from any parition of the document

### HDFS is not very good with:

1. __Low-latency requirements__: HDFS is designed with high throughput in mind,
usually giving up low-latency access for higher throughput in the design
decisions.

2. __Lots of small files__: The namenode holds the filesystem metadata in main
memory, meaning more files in the system means more memory needed in the
namenode. Too many files can slow down  the cluster or create a system crash.

    - Best to either concatonate files together or compress the files into a
compression format that is partitionable (each HDFS block is independently
readable)

    - YARN (MapReduce 2) has less problems with lots of small files but is a
problem

3. __Arbitrary file modifications__: Files in HDFS can only be written to by a
single writer by appending to the end of the file. The file can only be changed
at the end as otherwise it would have to shift all of the other bits in the file
(including other blocks) around.

# HDFS Concepts

__HDFS Block__: Data stored in HDFS is broken into chucks, 64 MB by default, but
128 MB or 256MB are commonly used, which are spread accross various nodes in
HDFS.
- HDFS blocks are best utitilized by having them evenly distributed across the
cluster and sufficiently large to justify creating a JVM for each map task.

- The block size is a balance of reduction of head seeks on disk, RAM memory
usage of bringing in blocks for map tasks, and distributing the blocks of the
file across the cluster

- A file smaller than the block will not occupy a full block's worth of
underlying storage

- Filesystem maintaince tools fsck can be used to work on blocks

__HDFS Federation__: For YARN (Hadoop 2.x) allows a cluster to have multiple
namenodes which manages mutually exclusive potions of the filesystem namespace.

- One NameNode might manage files/directories under /user and another manage
/share

- Manages a namespace volume: metadata of namespace, block pool (all blocks for
files in namespace).

- They are independent: if one NameNode fails, the others will still work just
fine.

__Balancer__: HDFS data is not always distributed evenly across the cluster, the
balancer moves blocks across the cluster to create a rough balance.

- Keep one of the replicas of a block on the same node that it is writing the
block

- One of the replicas is placed in the same rack as IO is preformed

- Spread different replicas across racks to ensure no data loss with loss of a
rack (one replica on a different rack)

# Failure Recovery

There are several ways that a MapReduce job may fail. Failure recovery is thus
built into Hadoop:

1. A task failing.
    1. Exception is thrown. i.e. A corrupt block being read.
    2. Node running out of memory.
    3. A task operating too long without a status update.
2. A node failing (going offline).
3. A NameNode failing (the worst point of failure).

## Task Failing

If a map or reduce throws a exeception and it isn't caught in code, then the
task fails.

By default, if a map task fails, then it is first rerun on the same node then
tried one last time on a different node.

- By default, if a task fails 3 times then the job fails.

Possible Causes of exceptions:
- Reading a corrupt block
  - Handle the exception in code (catch the exception)
  - A bad record can be skipped by enabling skipping mode using `SkipBadRecords`
class

- Bad formatting of the file
    - Ensure correct formatting of the file
    - Handle problems in code

- Node running out of memory
    - Write memory efficient code

## Lack of Updates

After 10 mins, by default, of no updates from a task Hadoop tries to kill the
task and rerun the task while running procedures to ensure consistency.

- Ensure regular updates: either updating a counter, or writing to stderr (which
is then sent to the client)
    - This is really important for monte carlo simulations on hadoop.

## Node Failing

If a DataNode fails, Hadoop tries isolating the node from the system and
reassigning tasks that DataNode was operating on.

## NameNode Failing

If a NameNode fails then the whole system (or at least a partition of it for
2.x) is down. The system recovers by setting up a new NameNode via the
information in the Secondary NameNode as well as the edit logs. However since
there is a lag between the NameNode's operation and edit logs there is almost
always __data loss__ after recovery.

- One cause of NameNode failure is too many files in the system:
    - The NameNode keeps all metadata for HDFS files in memory, more files means
more memory is needed and NameNode failing due to lack of memory.
    - It is __HIGHLY__ recommended to keep most if not all data for a MapReduce
job in a single file

With Hadoop 1.x can take about 30 mins for a new NameNode to be setup while
Hadoop 2.x usually takes a min or two.

# Hadoop Operations

## Running Hadoop Jobs

Three basic ways of runing MapReduce jobs:

1. __Java MapReduce__ MapReduce Job written in Java
    - Most efficient method
2. Running __Hadoop Streaming__ with other languages: C++, Python, etc.
    - Easiest to use but least efficient interface
3. __Hadoop Pipes__: C++ interface using sockets between Java and C++

### Java MapReduce

Hadoop is written in Java code, thus one of the main ways of running MapReduce
jobs is with Java.  

```
$ hadoop jar <java file> [mainClass] args...
```

### Hadoop Streaming

Hadoop Streaming allows Hadoop to use any programming languages with stdin,
stdout: C++, Python, Perl, etc.  

```
$ hadoop jar ${HADOOP_HOME}/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-*.jar \
        -input <InputDirs> \
        -output <OutputDir> \
        [-file <MapperFileToBeSent>] \
        -mapper <MapperFile> \
        [-file <ReducerFileToBeSent>] \
        -reducer <ReducerFile>
```

- Hadoop Cheatsheet gives an outline of how to use this
    - Remember any files to be used must be sent using -file option (the mapper
and reducer nodes need a copy of the files)

#### Hadoop Streaming: Ver 1.x vs 2.x   

Hadoop Streaming for version 1.x can only use text for stdin and stdout, while
2.x is not.

__1.x__ This means that stdin takes in text and then break the text back into
the datatypes needed for computations.stdout is a print statement with a tab
character seperating keys (\t)

__2.x__ Can do text as well as stream objects
- Python would use emit() function to pass along each key-value pair instead of
printing like in 1.x

### Hadoop Pipes

We can connect to Hadoop C++ via pipes operator. Pipes makes a socket connect
from Java to C++.

We can run a pipes job by the command:  

```
hadoop pipes \
    -input inputPath \
    -output outputPath \
    -program path/to/C++/executable
```

# MapReduce Properties

Hadoop is __highly__ configurable, both on the admin and MapReduce job side.
- Most options are for performance tuning but some can do significantly change a MapReduce job 
	- i.e. change the input split to number of lines instead block size (useful for Monte Carlo simulations and web crawling multiple websites)


# Debugging Hadoop

Hadoop can run in 3 different modes, 2 of which are are useful for debugging:
1. __Local__: Hadoop installed an a single machine, everything is run in a
single JVM instance, thus making tracking down problems easier.
2. __Pseudo-Distribution__: Essentially a 1 node cluster. Useful for finding
problems related to the distributed nature of Hadoop.
3. __Full-Distribution__: A hadoop system installed on a cluster.

## Counters

Hadoop has various counters associated with a job (i.e. how many map, reduce
tasks have run etc.).

Counters have the dual purpose of keeping the system informed that a task is
still running as well as metrics on a jobs progress.  Custom counters can also
be written in Java.

# Hadoop Streaming and R

## Setting Environment Settings for R

Either run the following code in R, each time you need to do a Hadoop job:

```
#The Hadoop installation directory
Sys.setenv("HADOOP_PREFIX"="/usr/local/hadoop/2.*")
#The location for Hadoop executable
Sys.setenv("HADOOP_CMD"="/usr/local/hadoop/2.*/bin/hadoop")
#The location of hadoop streaming jar file
Sys.setenv("HADOOP_STREAMING"="/usr/local/hadoop/2.*/share/hadoop/tools/lib
/hadoop-streaming-2.*.jar")
```

or include the following into ~/.bashrc file

```
export HADOOP_PREFIX=${HADOOP_HOME}
export HADOOP_CMD=${HADOOP_HOME}/bin/hadoop
export HADOOP_STREAMING=${HADOOP_HOME}/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-
streaming-*.jar
```

## rmr2: mapreduce

__mapreduce__ Defines and executes a map reduce job. (Pkg rmr2)

```
mapreduce(input, output = NULL, map = to.map(identity),
    reduce = NULL, combine = NULL,
    input.format = "native",
    output.format = "native",
    vectorized.reduce = FALSE,
    in.memory.combine = FALSE,
    backend.parameters = list(),
    verbose = TRUE)
```

- __input__ Can be:
    - A set of file paths in HDFS
    - A __Big Data Object__ (a stub of information on some data in HDFS)
    - A _list_ of a combination of both

- __output__ A path to the destination folder on HDFS; if missing, a Big Data
Object is returned.

- __map__ An optional R map function that returns either NULL or a keyval object

- __reduce__ An optional R reduce function that returns either NULL or a keyval
object

- __combine__ refers to:

    - A function with the same signature and possible return values as the
reduce function, or

    - TRUE, which means use the reduce function as combiner.

    - NULL means no combiner is used.

- __input.format__ Input format specification, see make.input.format
![alt text](Images/input.format.png)

- __output.format__ Output format specification, see make.output.format
![alt text](Images/output.format.png)

## rmr2: keyval

- __keyval(key, val)__ Function that returns key-value pair, only val can ever
be NULL. This is what mapper, reducer and combiner functions return.

## rmr2: from.dfs

__from.dfs__ Read R objects from HDFS.  

```
from.dfs(input, format = "native")
```

- __input__ A valid path to HDFS or a big.data.object

- __format__ Either

    - A string naming the format, or

    - A value returned by the function make.input.format

## rmr2: to.dfs

__to.dfs__ Write R objects to HDFS and return a Big Data Object. (Useful for
test purposes only)  

```
to.dfs(kv, output = dfs.tempfile(), format = "native")
```

- __input__ A valid path to HDFS or a big.data.object

- __format__ Either

    - A string naming the format, or

    - A value returned by the function make.input.format

## rmr2: keys( ) and values( )

__keys__ Get keys from a big data object or HDFS file path
```
keys(kv)
```

__values__ Get values from a big data object or HDFS file path

```
values(kv)
```

## rmr2: Preamble

For rmr2 to work, some variables need to be set in bash:
```
Sys.setenv("HADOOP_PREFIX"="/usr/local/hadoop/2.2.0")
Sys.setenv("HADOOP_CMD"="/usr/local/hadoop/2.2.0/bin/hadoop")
Sys.setenv("HADOOP_STREAMING"=
    "/usr/local/hadoop/2.2.0/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-2.2.0.jar")
```

## Some Useful R Functions

### system
__system__ Invokes OS command specified by the character string command. (Pkg
base)

```
system(command, intern = FALSE,
       ignore.stdout = FALSE, ignore.stderr = FALSE,
       wait = TRUE, input = NULL, show.output.on.console = TRUE,
       minimized = FALSE, invisible = TRUE)
```

- __command__ Character string to be invoked in terminal.

- __intern__ a logical (not NA) which indicates whether to capture the output of
the command as an R character vector.

- __ignore.stdout, ignore.stderr__ a logical (not NA) indicating whether
messages written to ‘stdout’ or ‘stderr’ should be ignored.

- __wait__ a logical (not NA) indicating whether the R interpreter should wait
for the command to finish, or run it asynchronously. This will be ignored (and
the interpreter will always wait) if intern = TRUE.

- __input__ if a character vector is supplied, this is copied one string per
line to a temporary file, and the standard input of command is redirected to the
file.

- __show.output.on.console__, minimized, invisible arguments that are accepted
on Windows but ignored on this platform, with a warning.

__Example:__ Command for hadoop to remove previous contents of out  

```
system("${HADOOP_CMD} fs -rm -r /user/darrellaucoin/out")
```

---
### file.path
__file.path__ Construct a path from components to be easily translated accross
different OS (Mac, Windows, Linux). (Pkg base)  

```
file.path(...)
```

- __...__ character vectors

__Example:__ Command for hadoop to remove previous contents of out  

```
hdfs.root <-'/user/darrellaucoin'
input <- file.path(hdfs.root, 'input')
```

---

### strsplit
__strsplit__ Split elements of a character vector x into substrings, split with
matches to the regular expression in split argument. (Pkg base)

```
strsplit(x, split, fixed = FALSE, perl = FALSE, useBytes = FALSE)
```

- __x__ character vector

- __split__ character vector containing regular expressions to tell when to
break the substring. If split has length 0, x is split to individual characters.

- __perl__ logical. Should perl-compatible regular expressions be used?

- __useBytes__ logical. Should matching be done byte by byte?

__Example:__

```
str = 'this is a string'
strsplit(str, split = ' ')
```

---
### list
__list__ construct a list from the objects. A list is like a vector that can
have different datatypes.

```
list(x, all.names = FALSE)
```

- __...__ objects to coerced into a list

- __x__ object to coerced into a list

- __all.names__ logical. whether to copy all values or (default) only those
whose names do not begin with a dot.

__Example:__

```
a.list = list(1,2,3,'string', 2.23, lm(y~x))
```

---
### unlist
__unlist__ Simplifies a list structure x to a vector containing atomic
components which occur in x. (Pkg base)

```
unlist(x, recursive = TRUE, use.names = TRUE)
```

- __x__ a list or vector

- __recurvisve__ logical

- __use.names__ logical. Should names be preserved?
__Example:__

```
vec = unlist(a.list)
```
---
### write
__write__

```
write(x, file = "data",
      ncolumns = if(is.character(x)) 1 else 5,
      append = FALSE, sep = " ")
```

- __x__ the data to be written

- __file__ connection or character string naming the file to written to.
    - For Hadoop, we want to write to standard error (`stderr()`) for it to go
to the client.

- __ncolumns__ number of columns to write the data in

- __append__ if TRUE the data are appended to the connection.

- __sep__ string used to serparate the columns

__Example:__

```
write("prints to stderr", stderr())
```

## Debugging Hadoop within R

Debugging is essential to running a MapReduce job and ensuring everything is
working correctly. As such, we have two functions to help us debugg code:

1. __rmr.options__ when we are running on hadoop (either in pseudo-distribution
or full-distribution mode). When in hadoop mode, there are several options to
collect information to help debug.

    - When trying to look for bugs it is usually best look in local mode to find
potential problems within R, then failing that look in pseudo-distributed mode
for any problems (connections problems between R and Hadoop etc.) Profiling
works by writing out the call stack every interval seconds, to the file
specified

2. __Rprof__ when we are running on local mode (using `rmr.options(backend =
"local")` ). When local mode is turned on, hadoop is never run but a simulation
of hadoop entirely within R is run, as such Rprof is used to collect any
debugging information we might need.

__rmr.options__ Set and get package options. (Pkg rmr2)

```
rmr.options(backend = c("hadoop", "local"),
        profile.nodes = c("off", "calls", "memory", "both"),
        hdfs.tempdir = "/tmp",
        exclude.objects = NULL,
        backend.parameters = list())
```

- __...__ Names of options to get values of, as length of one character vectors.

- __backend__ Use either hadoop, or the current R interpreter, sequentially, for
learning and debugging.

![alt text](Images/backend.png)

- __profile.nodes__ Collect profiling and memory information when running
additional R interpreters (besides the current one) on the cluster. No effect on
the local backend, use Rprof instead. For backward compatibility, "calls" is
equivalent to TRUE and "off" to FALSE

![alt text](Images/profile.nodes.png)

__Rprof__ when we are running on local mode (using `rmr.options(backend =
"local")` ). When local mode is turned on, hadoop is never run but a simulation
of hadoop entirely within R is run, as such Rprof is used to collect any
debugging information we might need.
`summaryRprof`
- Functions will only be recorded in the profile log if they put a context on
the call stack

- Individual statements will be recorded in the profile log if line.profiling is
set to TRUE, and if the code being executed was parsed with source references.

# Hadoop Examples



## Word Count

We want a word count in a text (or group of texts).

```
Sys.setenv("HADOOP_PREFIX"="/usr/local/hadoop/2.5.2")
Sys.setenv("HADOOP_CMD"="/usr/local/hadoop/2.5.2/bin/hadoop")
Sys.setenv("HADOOP_STREAMING"=
    "/usr/local/hadoop/2.5.2/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-2.5.2.jar")
library(rmr2)
library(data.table)
system('${HADOOP_CMD} fs -rm -r /user/darrellaucoin/out/')
map=function(k,lines) {
    words.list = strsplit(lines, ' ')
    words = unlist(words.list)
    return( keyval(words, 1) )
}

reduce=function(word, counts) {
    keyval(word, sum(counts))
}
mapreduce(input='/user/darrellaucoin/input/War_and_Peace.txt',
    output='/user/darrellaucoin/out',
    input.format="text",
    map=map,
    reduce=reduce
)
count = from.dfs('/user/darrellaucoin/out')
results = as.data.table(count)
setnames(results, c('word', 'count'))
results[order(results$count, decreasing=T), ]
```


## Linear Regression

To understand the MapReduce framework, lets solve a familar problem of Linear
Regression. For Hadoop/MapReduce to work we MUST figure out how to parallelize
our code, in other words how to use the hadoop system to only need to make a
subset of our calculations on a subset of our data.

__Assumption__: The value of p, the number of explanatory variables is small
enough for R to easily handle i.e.
$$n\gg p$$

We know from linear regression, that our estimate of $\hat{\beta}$:
![alt text](Images/linear_reg1.png)

$\left(X^{T}X\right)_{p\times p}$ and $\left(X^{T}y\right)_{p\times1}$ is small
enough for R to solve for $\hat{\beta}$, thus we only need $X^{T}X,X^{T}y$ to
get $\hat{\beta}$.

To break up this calculation we break our matrix $X$ into submatricies $X_{i}$:  

![alt text](Images/linear_reg.png)

```
Sys.setenv("HADOOP_PREFIX"="/usr/local/hadoop/2.5.2")
Sys.setenv("HADOOP_CMD"="/usr/local/hadoop/2.5.2/bin/hadoop")
Sys.setenv("HADOOP_STREAMING"=
    "/usr/local/hadoop/2.5.2/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-2.5.2.jar")
library(rmr2)
library(data.table)
#Setup variables
p = 10
num.obs = 200
beta.true = 1:(p+1)
X = cbind(rep(1,num.obs), matrix(rnorm(num.obs * p),
    ncol = p))
y = X %*% beta.true + rnorm(num.obs)
X.index = to.dfs(cbind(y, X))
rm(X, y, num.obs, p)
map.XtX = function(., Xi) {
    Xi = Xi[,-1] #Get rid of y values in Xi
    keyval(1, list(t(Xi) %*% Xi))
}
map.Xty = function(., Xi) {
    yi = Xi[,1] # Retrieve the y values
    Xi = Xi[,-1] #Get rid of y values in Xi
    keyval(1, list(t(Xi) %*% yi))
}
Sum = function(., YY) {
    keyval(1, list(Reduce('+', YY)))
}

```


- The reason we are returning a list in the map function is because otherwise
Reduce will only return a some of the elements of the matricies.

    - list prevents this by Reduce iterating though the elements of the list
(the individual $X_{i}^{T}X_{i}$  matricies) and applying the binary function
'+' to each one.

    - list is used in the reduce function `Sum` because we will also use this as
a combiner function and if we didn't use a list we would have the same problem
as above.

```
XtX = values(from.dfs(
    mapreduce(input = X.index,
    map = map.XtX,
    reduce = Sum,
    combine = TRUE)))[[1]]

Xty = values(from.dfs(
    mapreduce(
    input = X.index,
    map = map.Xty,
    reduce = Sum,
    combine = TRUE)))[[1]]
beta.hat = solve(XtX, Xty)
print(beta.hat)
```

# Your Data isn't THAT BIG

Hadoop has several difficulties and limitations:

- Paradigm shift of MapReduce: re-vision (and recoding) algorithms into the
paradigm of MapReduce

- Debugging code is more difficult than just regular code

- Data security isn't as well defined as most SQL engines

## Alternatives

__Q:__ Is there a way of fitting the data in memory?

- A gigabyte csv file can be loaded into memory on most computers

__Q:__ Can the process be done reading lines from a file?

- R and Python have functions like `readLines` that can read a file line by line

__Q:__ Can a SQL server handle the information/calculation?

- SQL doesn't require all data to be loaded into memory to execute it's queries
    - SQL can handle queries over many Gigabytes of data

- SQL tables can be indexed (unlike Hadoop) making for faster processing time

- R packages like `dplyr` can translate _some_ R-code into SQL queries and can
execute said code with a SQL backend
    - Can also execute SQL queries from R, importing the results into a
dataframe

- PostgreSQL has an extension ([MADlib](http://madlib.net/)) allowing Machine
Learning algorithms to run over large datasets on PostgreSQL

__Q:__ What if the data isn't structured for SQL tables? i.e. JSON file, binary
blobs

- PostgreSQL does have a JSON datatype

- Can process the file using a script, reading line by line and then write to
file as needed
